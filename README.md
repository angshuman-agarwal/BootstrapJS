# BootstrapJS
Bootstrap a simple Javascript Project with modern webpack tooling -

- git clone https://github.com/angshuman-agarwal/BootstrapJS.git 
- On your your local machine, cd into BootstrapJS folder
- Spawn your favourite command line tool at this location & execute the following:
  - npm install
  - npm run build
  - npm start

That should spawn a browser served by lite-server on localhost and show a alert box with 'Hi' as the text when the page loads. 
This is the minimal scaffolding required to bootstrap a modern Javascript project using webpack
